                <div id="aboutMe">
                    <p>Hello! I am a software engineer based out of Minneapolis, MN. I currently specialize in
                        JavaScript and Java while
                        I first started coding in
                        Python. I am passionate about improving design,
                        user
                        experience and program efficiency. I love to help clients grow and improve their technology as
                        seamlessly as possible.</p>
                    <p>Prior to tech, I spent 7 years working in the fast-paced agency world of digital marketing.
                        From
                        keeping up with the latest platforms, I know how to learn and adapt to new technologies quickly.
                        Through
                        managing client goals and expectations, I've developed my skills in proactive communication and
                        relationship
                        management. I have also worked in many cross-functional teams and enjoy collaboration and team
                        projects.
                        I am
                        excited to leverage my skills gained in marketing to help my clients in tech succeed.</p>
                    <p>In my free time I love spending time outdoors, hiking, skiing and mountain biking! I enjoy
                        traveling to go on adventures in new places (New Zealand and Switzerland have topped my hiking
                        favorites) and try all kinds of fun cuisines (shoutout to Italy and India
                        for amazing food). </p>
